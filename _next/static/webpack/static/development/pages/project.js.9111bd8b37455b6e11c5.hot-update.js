MorphIO’s hardware consists of a soft pneumatic actuator containing a conductive sponge sensor. This allows both input and output of three-dimensional defor- mation of a soft material. Leveraging this capability, MorphIO enables a user to record and later playback physical motion of programmable shape-changing materials. In addition, the modular design of MorphIO’s unit allows the user to construct various shapes and topologies through magnetic connection. We demonstrate several application scenarios, including tangi- ble character animation, locomotion experiment of a soft robot, and prototyping tools for animated soft objects. Our user study with six participants confirms the benefits of MorphIO, as compared to the existing programming paradigm.\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable three column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable two column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n# Motivation\n\n**Programmable soft materials** have a great impact in many application fields, such as soft robots, material interfaces, and haptics.\n**However, programming of such materials is hard.**\nThe dominant programming paradigm of soft robots and material interfaces is largely confined within a digital screen, leaving little room for users to interactively explore physical motion through tangible interaction.

This allows for integrated and entirely soft shape-changing modules that can both sense and actuate a variety of three-dimensional deformations. Leveraging this capability, MorphIO enables the user to program behaviors by recording and later playing back physical motions through tangible interaction. In addition, the modular design of MorphIO’s unit allows the user to construct various shapes and topologies through magnetic connection, then synthesize multiple recorded motions to achieve more complex behaviors, such as bending, gripping, and walking.\n\n\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/module.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n\n<br/>\n\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/bear.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n\n# Entirely Soft Sensing and Actuation Modules\n\nIn our hardware contribution, we describe a design and fabrication method for a conductive sponge sensor that can be embedded into an air chamber in the pneumatic actuator. The conductive sponge sensor leverages the porous structure to sense the three-dimensional deformation by measuring the internal resistance value; when contracted, the resistance value be- tween the top and bottom surfaces drops, and when extended, it increases. In contrast to existing sensing techniques, an elastic sponge allows for a higher degree of freedom in sensing capability (e.g., stretching, bending, and compression) without sacrificing the softness of the interface.\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable two column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/mechanism.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n<br />\n\nMoreover, our modular design and graphical interface allows for easy experiments involving multiple units. For example, the system can visualize multiple recorded sensor values, so that the user can see, customize, and synthesize recorded motion to construct more complex behaviors. These hardware and software designs were informed by our formative study, wherein we interviewed five experienced researchers from the robotics and HCI communities.\n\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable two column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-5-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-5-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-5-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-5-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable one column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n# Fabrication Process\n\nThe fabrication process follows three steps: 1) Fabricate an elastic sponge, 2) impregnate into conductive ink, and 3) attach electrodes and wires.\nTo fabricate an elastic sponge, we first prepare 6.0 g of elastomer prepolymer solution (Smootn-on Inc. Ecoflex 00-50) and 29.1 g of sodium-chloride (Naruto Salt Mfg Co. Ltd), then mix them together by using a planetary centrifugal mixer (Thinky Inc. AR-100). The mixed solution is injected into a 3D printed cylindrical mold (16mm diameter, 40mm height). Then we dry the material with an oven (Yamato Science Co. Ltd, DVS 402) at 100 C degrees for one hour. (While it can be dried in room temperature, we used an oven to shorten the fabrication time.) Once dried, we immerse the sponge in water, so that the sodium chloride can melt, leaving a porous structure within the elastomer sponge.\n\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/fabrication.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable four column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-4.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-4.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable three column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n# System\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Applications\n\n\n\n# Future Vision","bodyHtml":"<h1>MorphIO: Entirely Soft Sensing and Actuation Modules for Programming Shape Changes through Tangible Interaction</h1>\n<p>Ryosuke Nakayama*, **Ryo Suzuki* **, Satoshi Nakamaru, Ryuma Niiyama, Yoshihiro Kawahara, Yasuaki Kakehi\n<br/>\n(the first two authors equally contributed)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dis2019.com/\"><strong>The ACM conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS 2019)</strong></a></p>\n<p>Links:\n[<strong><a href=\"http://ryosuzuki.org/publications/dis-2019-morphio.pdf\">PDF</a></strong>]\n[<strong><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3322337\">ACM DL</a></strong>]\n[<strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nPlr3O9xu8\">Video</a></strong>]</p>\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/top.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n<h1>Abstract</h1>\n<p>We introduce MorphIO, entirely soft sensing and actuation modules for programming by demonstration of soft robots and shape-changing interfaces.
