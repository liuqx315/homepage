MorphIO’s hardware consists of a soft pneumatic actuator containing a conductive sponge sensor. This allows both input and output of three-dimensional defor- mation of a soft material. Leveraging this capability, MorphIO enables a user to record and later playback physical motion of programmable shape-changing materials. In addition, the modular design of MorphIO’s unit allows the user to construct various shapes and topologies through magnetic connection. We demonstrate several application scenarios, including tangi- ble character animation, locomotion experiment of a soft robot, and prototyping tools for animated soft objects. Our user study with six participants confirms the benefits of MorphIO, as compared to the existing programming paradigm.\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable three column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable two column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-4-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n# Motivation\n\n**Programmable soft materials** have a great impact in many application fields, such as soft robots, material interfaces, and haptics.\n**However, programming of such materials is hard.**\nThe dominant programming paradigm of soft robots and material interfaces is largely confined within a digital screen, leaving little room for users to interactively explore physical motion through tangible interaction.

This allows for integrated and entirely soft shape-changing modules that can both sense and actuate a variety of three-dimensional deformations. Leveraging this capability, MorphIO enables the user to program behaviors by recording and later playing back physical motions through tangible interaction. In addition, the modular design of MorphIO’s unit allows the user to construct various shapes and topologies through magnetic connection, then synthesize multiple recorded motions to achieve more complex behaviors, such as bending, gripping, and walking.\n\n\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/module.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n\n<br/>\n\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/bear.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n\n# Entirely Soft Sensing and Actuation Modules\n\nIn our hardware contribution, we describe a design and fabrication method for a conductive sponge sensor that can be embedded into an air chamber in the pneumatic actuator. The conductive sponge sensor leverages the porous structure to sense the three-dimensional deformation by measuring the internal resistance value; when contracted, the resistance value be- tween the top and bottom surfaces drops, and when extended, it increases. In contrast to existing sensing techniques, an elastic sponge allows for a higher degree of freedom in sensing capability (e.g., stretching, bending, and compression) without sacrificing the softness of the interface.\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable two column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/mechanism.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n<br />\n\nMoreover, our modular design and graphical interface allows for easy experiments involving multiple units. For example, the system can visualize multiple recorded sensor values, so that the user can see, customize, and synthesize recorded motion to construct more complex behaviors. These hardware and software designs were informed by our formative study, wherein we interviewed five experienced researchers from the robotics and HCI communities.\n\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable two column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-5-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-5-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-5-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-5-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable one column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-3-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n# Fabrication Process\n\nThe fabrication process follows three steps: 1) Fabricate an elastic sponge, 2) impregnate into conductive ink, and 3) attach electrodes and wires.\nTo fabricate an elastic sponge, we first prepare 6.0 g of elastomer prepolymer solution and 29.1 g of sodium-chloride, then mix them together by using a planetary centrifugal mixer. The mixed solution is injected into a 3D printed cylindrical mold (16mm diameter, 40mm height). Then we dry the material with an oven at 100 C degrees for one hour. Once dried, we immerse the sponge in water, so that the sodium chloride can melt, leaving a porous structure within the elastomer sponge.\n\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/fabrication.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable four column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-4.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-6-4.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable three column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-8-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n# System\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Applications\n\nBased on the proposed hardware and software, we demonstrate several possible applications scenarios with MorphIO.\nTangible Character Animation\nWith MorphIO, the user can easily create an animation of a tangible character. Taking inspiration from Disney’s animation principles [38], such an animated character can react and express emotion to the user through motion.\nFor example, Figure 21 shows that the user designs the be- havior of the communication robot by using three MorphIO modules and connectors. The end user can thus explore ex- pressive motion in the physical world. Similar to [14] and [36],\nthese robots can serve as a communication robot to interact with children.\nAnimating Existing Soft Objects\nThe MorphIO module can be also attached to existing ob- jects to actuate them. For example, Figure 22 shows the user animating a stuffed animal with a MorphIO module.\nFigure 22. The MorphIO unit can be attached to the stuffed animal, so that the user can animate and remotely control the existing object.\nThe attached module can be synchronized with the other mod- ule in real time, so that the user can remotely animate the stuffed animal by binding the control module to her fingers. These animated stuffed animals can be used in communication or storytelling with children.\nRemote Manipulation of Soft Grippers\nBy leveraging real-time synchronization, the user can also remotely manipulate the soft grippers. By using the tripod connector, three MorphIO modules can be connected, and these modules can grasp a ball (Figure 23).\nFigure 23. By using the tripod connector, three MorphIO modules can be used as a soft gripper.\nAnother example includes a real-time remote assistant for rehabilitation or training, as accessibility and rehabilitation assistants are a promising application for soft robotics. Thus, by attaching the MorphIO module to the body, a doctor can re- motely assist the patient, or a trainer can provide synchronized guidance for movement, dancing, and sports.\nLocomotion Experimentation with Soft Robots\nFinally, we demonstrate that MorphIO modules can be ap- plied for the locomotion of soft robots. Usually, it is difficult for robotic researchers to explore diffing locomotion of soft robots. Because of its modularity, MorphIO allows for quick experimentation with different topology and motion designs.\n\n  Figure 24. By combining five MorphIO modules, a user can design and experiment with the locomotion of a soft robot.\nFor example, Figure 24 shows a walking robot by using five modules which combine the air chamber at the center. By demonstrating tangible interactions, one can explore differ- ing locomotion, such as speed, orientation, and mechanisms. Since it is usually difficult to effectively control five modules at the same time by traditional programming, tangible demon- stration can significantly lower the barrier of iteration and exploration of soft robotic locomotion.\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable four column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-4.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-4.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable three column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/locomotion.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n\n\n\n\n# Future Vision","bodyHtml":"<h1>MorphIO: Entirely Soft Sensing and Actuation Modules for Programming Shape Changes through Tangible Interaction</h1>\n<p>Ryosuke Nakayama*, **Ryo Suzuki* **, Satoshi Nakamaru, Ryuma Niiyama, Yoshihiro Kawahara, Yasuaki Kakehi\n<br/>\n(the first two authors equally contributed)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dis2019.com/\"><strong>The ACM conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS 2019)</strong></a></p>\n<p>Links:\n[<strong><a href=\"http://ryosuzuki.org/publications/dis-2019-morphio.pdf\">PDF</a></strong>]\n[<strong><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3322337\">ACM DL</a></strong>]\n[<strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nPlr3O9xu8\">Video</a></strong>]</p>\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/top.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n<h1>Abstract</h1>\n<p>We introduce MorphIO, entirely soft sensing and actuation modules for programming by demonstration of soft robots and shape-changing interfaces.

Since it is usually difficult to effectively control five modules at the same time by traditional programming, tangible demon- stration can significantly lower the barrier of iteration and exploration of soft robotic locomotion.</p>\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable four column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-4.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-10-4.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable three column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-11-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<video preload=\"metadata\" autoPlay loop muted playsInline webkit-playsinline=\"\">\n  <source src=\"/static/projects/morphio/locomotion.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n</video>\n<h1>Future Vision</h1>\n","dir":"content/output/projects","base":"morphio.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"morphio.md","sourceExt":".md"};
