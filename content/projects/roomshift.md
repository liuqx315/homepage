# Abstract

This paper presents RoomShift, a room-scale dynamic haptic environment for virtual reality, based on a small swarm of robots that can move furniture. RoomShift consists of nine shape-changing robots based on Roombas with mechanical scissor lifts. These robots drive beneath a piece of furniture to lift, move and place it. By augmenting virtual scenes with physical objects, users can sit on, lean against, place and otherwise interact with furniture with their whole body; just as in the real world. When the virtual scene changes or users navigate inside it, the swarm of robots dynamically reconfig- ures the physical environment to match the virtual content. We describe the technical hardware and software implementation, applications in virtual tours and architectural design and interaction techniques.
