  "bodyContent": "# Abstract\n\nThis paper introduces LiftTiles, a modular and reconfigurable room-scale shape display. LiftTiles consist of an array of retractable and inflatable actuator that is compact (e.g., 15cm tall) and light (e.g., 1.8kg), while extending up to 1.5m to allow for large-scale shape transformation. Inflatable actuation also provides a robust structure that can support heavy objects (e.g., 10 kg weight). This paper describes the design and implementation of LiftTiles and explores the application space for reconfigurable room-scale shape displays.",
