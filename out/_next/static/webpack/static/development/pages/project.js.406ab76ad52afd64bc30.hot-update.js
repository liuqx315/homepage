MorphIO’s hardware consists of a soft pneumatic actuator containing a conductive sponge sensor. This allows both input and output of three-dimensional defor- mation of a soft material. Leveraging this capability, MorphIO enables a user to record and later playback physical motion of programmable shape-changing materials. In addition, the modular design of MorphIO’s unit allows the user to construct various shapes and topologies through magnetic connection. We demonstrate several application scenarios, including tangi- ble character animation, locomotion experiment of a soft robot, and prototyping tools for animated soft objects. Our user study with six participants confirms the benefits of MorphIO, as compared to the existing programming paradigm.\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable three column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-3.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-1-3.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"figures ui stackable one column grid\">\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-1.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-1.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"figure column\">\n    <a href=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-2.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"/static/projects/morphio/figure-2-2.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n# Introduction\n\n**Programmable soft materials** have a great impact in many application fields, such as soft robots, material interfaces, and haptics.\n**However, programming of such materials is hard.**\nThe dominant programming paradigm of soft robots and material interfaces is largely confined within a digital screen, leaving little room for users to interactively explore physical motion through tangible interaction.
