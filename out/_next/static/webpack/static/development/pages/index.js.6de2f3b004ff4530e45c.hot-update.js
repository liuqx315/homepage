MorphIO’s hardware consists of a soft pneumatic actuator containing a conductive sponge sensor. This allows both input and output of three-dimensional defor- mation of a soft material. Leveraging this capability, MorphIO enables a user to record and later playback physical motion of programmable shape-changing materials. In addition, the modular design of MorphIO’s unit allows the user to construct various shapes and topologies through magnetic connection. We demonstrate several application scenarios, including tangi- ble character animation, locomotion experiment of a soft robot, and prototyping tools for animated soft objects. Our user study with six participants confirms the benefits of MorphIO, as compared to the existing programming paradigm.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nPneumatically actuated soft materials have attracted much at- tention in the HCI and robotics communities. In contrast to traditional rigid materials, soft materials have a unique capabil- ity of deformation, movement, and flexibility, which enables the rich expression and function of shape-changing physical objects. While the idea of pneumatic actuation was originally explored in soft robotic literature, recent research in HCI has demonstrated the great potential of soft actuation methods for user interaction.\n\nWhen we interact with these soft material interfaces, they allow rich embodiment and intuitive manipulation through tangible interactions. However, when we program them, such intuitive operations disappear; the dominant programming paradigm of soft robots and material interfaces is largely confined within a digital screen, leaving little room for users to interactively explore physical motion through tangible interaction. In such a workflow—compiling code on a digital screen then trans- ferring it into the physical object—users need to repeatedly switch between the digital and physical worlds. This leaves a large gulf of execution in their programming experiences [22]. Thus, the traditional programming paradigm significantly lim- its the user’s ability to experiment with the design of expressive motion. Moreover, due to this barrier, such an opportunity is largely limited to highly skilled programmers and researchers who are proficient in hardware programming.\n\nThis paper introduces MorphIO, entirely soft sensing and ac- tuation modules for programming by demonstration of soft robots and shape-changing interfaces (Figure 1). MorphIO’s hardware consists of a soft pneumatic actuator containing a conductive sponge sensor. This allows for integrated and en- tirely soft shape-changing modules that can both sense and actuate a variety of three-dimensional deformations. Lever- aging this capability, MorphIO enables the user to program behaviors by recording and later playing back physical mo- tions through tangible interaction. In addition, the modular design of MorphIO’s unit allows the user to construct various shapes and topologies through magnetic connection, then syn- thesize multiple recorded motions to achieve more complex behaviors, such as bending, gripping, and walking.\n\n\n# MorphIO\n\nThe MorphIO system consists of the following components: A sensor and actuation unit, a sensing and actuation control unit, a microcontroller, software to control these units, and a visual interface for users to control behaviors.\n\nTo enable this workflow, MorphIO has three key components:\n1.
